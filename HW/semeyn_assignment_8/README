Assignment 8 - Affine Gap Penalty

This program takes 6 command-line arguments.
The first argument is the name of the first DNA file in fasta format.
The second argument is the name of the second DNA file in fasta format.
The third argument is the penalty for the existence of a gap.
The fourth argument is the penalty for the extension of a gap.
The fifth argument is the score of an aligned match.
The sixth argument is the score of an aligned mismatch.

The main.py imports sys, fasta, and affine  for their functions.

The fasta.py imports the module sys and parses the input file to collect the DNA sequence, checking to make sure the only bases in the sequence are AGTC.

The affine.py imports sys and aligns the sequences using an affine gap penalty.

The alignment score and main matrix are printed as output.
