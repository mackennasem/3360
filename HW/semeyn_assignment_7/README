Assignment 7 - Global, Semi-Global, Local Alignment

This program takes 6 command-line arguments.
The first argument is the name of the first DNA file in fasta format.
The second argument is the name of the second DNA file in fasta format.
The third argument is the gap penalty.
The fourth argument is the score of an aligned match.
The fifth argument is the score of an aligned mismatch.
The sixth argument is the type of alignment: global, semi-global, or local.

The main.py imports sys, fasta, global_a, semi_global, and local modules for their functions.

The global_a.py imports the module sys and uses the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to implement global alignment.

The semi_global.py imports sys and the match function from global_a and aligns the sequences using a zero boundary and linear gap penalty.

The local.py imports match from global_a and traceback from semi_global and uses the Smith-Waterman algorithm to find the local alignment.
